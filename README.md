## 1.1. Introduction
[Problem definition and solutions identification]

Elon Dumond, an international diamond trader, needs to expand its market for selling more diamonds. He identifies that one of the main challenges for the diamond market is to find more customers that can afford to pay for the high price of diamonds. Elon came up with with a business idea to attract more customers by offering certified and high_grade diamonds as an investement opportunity given the continuous value appreciation of diamonds, and by selling tokens that are backed by diamonds through the blockchain worldwide. Diamonds are an ideal asset for backing a token since they are rare, take a billion years to develop, have several millennia of history as a recognized store of value, and are small and therefore easily stored and transported.

Elon has contacted the FT32 Consulting Group for developing the technology solution that will enable his business idea.

### Problem definition

Selling diamonds to customers requires to overcome the following obstacles:
1) Perceived Distrust - Customers fear of investing in a non-physical asset that is not secured or guaranteed by a bank or financial institution
2) Limited market - Very few investors would have a large capital to afford investing in high priced diamonds  
3) Accessibility - High priced diamonds are locked or heavily secured and they are not easily accessible to customers
4) Liquidity - The transaction of acquiring or selling a diamonds is complex and may require a long time
5) Skepticism to new technology - Blockchain is new technology with an steep learning curve and it is slowly being understood by investors

## 1.2. Diamond Market and Economy 
 Overall, the long-term outlook for the diamond market is positive, with demand for raw diamonds expected to grow at about 2% to 5% every year in the long term1. Much of this is driven by strong demand by the middle-class in the US, China and India.
Furthermore, global diamond supply is constrained as diamonds are a finite natural resource, and the demand-supply gap is thus projected to widen over time with a forecasted decrease in diamond production2. As the value of the mDia token is to a certain extent tied to that of diamonds, the mDia token could thus appreciate in value over time as diamonds continue to benefit from positive pricing forces, continuing the historical trend from 1960 to 20163. This signifies the potential of the mDia token as a strong store of wealth with capital gains. (Reference: Whitepaper..)
